			<p><b>CCS 1: Thicker Than Blood:</b> In the first installment, we get a strong introduction into the company, as well as the personal life of Connor. We learn soon that his wife died durring the birth of his daughter, Willow. His daughter is married now and one of the first missions is the wedding. We cut to two years later, when we learn his grandson is being born, but his daughter has a disease thats killing her. She also dies giving birth. He bonds with his son-in-law, Joey, is dying of the same disease. Connor works with Joey and creates the curupted syrum, but before giving it to Joey, tests it on himself. The syrum, instead of nothing, as it was intended to on unaffected people, it creates a evil clone made of a strange black and magenta goo, nearly killing him. The creature escapes, with unknown motives. Curupted Corner is the name this clone takes, for unkown reasons. He makes his way to the sewer and quickly finds an abandoned reasearch facility. He makes this his home. Curupted Corner then begins building equipment for tests. Going back to Connor, he wakes up and gets off the floor, with no other option, he puts Joey and his grandson, Frin, in cryostasis. He quickly finds out any grudges or bad in him has seemingly vanished. He figures out that Curupted Corner is all of the evil that ever existed in him, in a physical form. He calls a meeting with the heads of all the different departments: Ugine Notza, Head of Robotics and Engineering, Warren Gillian, Head of Medical, Brill Hildibrain, Head of Magic, Shocks Tarbilloff, Head of Auto-Mechanics, Astrellia Bronzie, Head of Transport, Rutherford Chance, Head of Treasury, Perrywinkle Burr, Head of Security, and Kane, Head of Teams. He discusses what has happened and to keep an eye out, since Curupted Corner is probably dangerous. Curupted Corner wastes no time kidnapping Brad Castily, a lieutenant in the military, and putting him in an experiment pod. He uses an orange cat and a frog and combines them with Brad to create a huminoid cat with the hands and feet of a frog, and maintaining his stature, stands at a massive 7 feet tall and 4 inches tall. He has no memory of who he was, and Curupted Corner dubs him "Commander Joe". He recrutes many more over the course of the rest of the game. Connor and Curupted Corner develop a rivalry and it ends on a climactic battle's end.</p>

			<p><b>CCS 2: The SCYTHE:</b> In the second game, we spend less time of world-building and more time on Curupted Corner's armada consisting of, Commander Joe, Workman Stanford, Rags, FISH, Soul Stealer, Big Larry, Sharkman, Tikiman, Eyeguy, and FLy HarT. Taking palce directly after the first game, we see Cybre Tech fixing the damage caused in the fight concluding Thicker Than Blood. We learn about Curupted Corner's sword. It's name: Promethius. He uses it to comunicate with the God of Death (The SCYTHE). He sells his soul in order to enlist The SCYTHE on his team,</p>

		<h3>Planned Company Departments-</h3>
		
		<h4>Technology and Engineering (Cybre Space)-</h4>
			<p> </p>
			<br>
		<h4>Reasearch and Development (Project Flaming Wolf)-</h4>
			<p>The goal of P.F.W. is to make the world a much better place. We can see glaring issues such as hunger, thirst, useless wars, pointless violence, and more. It's time someone with money and power used it to stop the problems of the world, not make them worse. P.F.W. is the means to exactlly the thing I want, an improved world. While Cybre Games publicly apears as my passion project, this is truly what I am passionate about, fixing this world 8 billion people call home. While being the last department invisioned, it is, by far the most important.</p>
			<br>
		<h4>Game Studio (Cybre Games)-</h4>
			<p>The public facing passion project of mine, Cybre Games focus on designing games for ideas I've always wanted to see played and experienced by thousands to millions of people. While a focus on my ideas will be in place to start, the ideas of others will be a priority as well. The game department was the first invisioned, making it important.</p>

		<h4>TV, Movie, and Animation Studio (Coggs)-</h4>
